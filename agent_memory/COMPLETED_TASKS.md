| P1-001 | Initialize repository and documented module structure | AGENTS.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, docs/*, agent_memory/*, module placeholders | Git initialized via Dulwich; source tree inspected |
| P1-002 | FastAPI configuration, health, secret-safe logs | backend/app/{main,config,database}.py, security/logging.py | Unit/integration/security/recovery suite passes |
| P1-003 | Admin authentication with durable sessions, origin/CSRF checks | auth/service.py, migration 0001_sessions | SQLite and PostgreSQL17.11 auth/expiry/revocation/migration recovery verified |
| P1-004 | Responsive HTML/CSS/JS shell and unavailable states | frontend/* | Chrome 390/768/1440px rendering/control checks passed |
| P1-005 | Repeatable test/lint/type dependency environment | pyproject.toml, uv.lock, tests/* | 41 tests pass with PostgreSQL; default37 pass/4 skipped; Ruff/mypy pass; prior dependency audit clean |
| P1-006 | Real PostgreSQL migration/authentication verification and disposable harness | scripts/verify_postgres.py, tests/integration/test_postgres.py | 2026-11-06: PostgreSQL17.11 SCRAM/non-superuser full suite41 passed; cluster stopped/removed |
| P1-007 | Environment startup regression fix | backend/app/config.py, tests/unit/test_config.py | 2026-11-06: shipped .env.example loads; truthy live flags rejected |
| P1-008 | Isolated Compose configuration verification | scripts/verify_compose.py, docker-compose.yml | 2026-11-06: standalone CLI 5.7.0 configuration and bundled Compose 5.6.1 runtime smoke pass |
| P1-VERIFY | Actual Docker image/runtime verification | scripts/verify_compose.py, docs/VERIFICATION.md | 2026-11-06: Docker 29.9.2/Compose 5.6.1 build/auth/UID/restart/DB-outage/recovery/CSRF checks passed; disposable containers/volume removed |

Phase 1 foundation and runtime verification are complete. No Phase 2–10 module is complete.
CI source invokes the same smoke command; CI execution remains unverified.

## Initial Phase2 iteration — 2026-11-06

| ID | Completed scope | Files | Actual verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-001 | Official read-only API/credential review | docs/BROKER_COMPLIANCE.md | Primary docs retrieved; endpoint/credential/rate matrix and unresolved execution gates recorded |
| P2-002A | Restricted Analytics credential/probe/local setup and dashboard control | brokers/upstox.py, api/broker.py, config.py, main.py, configure_upstox.py, frontend/* | Full PostgreSQL72 tests, Docker, browser and static checks pass; no real credential/acceptance claim |

Phase2 overall remains unfinished. OAuth, actual data acquisition and observation reports
are NOT complete. The operator has not supplied a real token; tests used synthetic fixtures.

## Instrument-master iteration — 2026-11-06

| ID | Task | Relevant files | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-003A | Official NSE index/derivative metadata import and immutable first-observed snapshots | instruments/*, api/instruments.py, migration0002, sync CLI, frontend and tests | PostgreSQL113 tests; actual public import83,940 source/6,504 selected; Docker and Chrome PASS; no execution eligibility |

Scope is NSE indices/index derivatives; full source gzip is retained. No lot/tick conversion
is fabricated. No operator database was provisioned by temporary verification.

## Historical-minute ingestion — 2026-11-06

| ID | Task | Files | Actual verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-003B | Prior-day1/5/15minute research history, validation/versioned storage/private APIs/UI | market_data/*, api/candles.py, broker adapter, migration0003, CLI/frontend/tests |152 PostgreSQL tests; Docker and Chrome synthetic flows PASS; no real broker history acceptance claim |

Full Phase2 is incomplete; broader/current/expired history and calendar completeness remain
outside this increment. No imported history is signal/execution eligible.

## Option-chain research snapshots — 2026-11-06T12:42:25Z

P2-003C complete within documented scope:catalog-bound explicit expiry/fixed GET, exact
price/quantity/Greek/identity validation, immutable canonical receipt/leg storage, diagnostic
missing/zero flags, private APIs/UI/CLI, migration0004.182 native PostgreSQL tests and Docker/
Chrome pass; actual broker chain acceptance remains unverified. All trading flags false.

## P2-003D — V3 feed foundation — 2026-11-06T12:52:13Z

Restricted fixed authorization GET, validated redacted one-use grant, catalog-bound LTPC
subscription bytes, pinned official schema/generated decoder, bounded normalized frames and
offline CLI complete.235 native PostgreSQL tests; Docker binary decoder/auth/recovery,
Ruff55/mypy23/lock/audit PASS. Actual broker acceptance unverified. No socket/trading enabled.

## P2-003E — bounded feed lifecycle — 2026-11-06T13:05:26Z

Restricted WSS transport, status/snapshot ordering, fresh grant/catalog each reconnect, bounded
heartbeat/backoff/duration/cancellation/sink, duplicate/out-of-order filtering and aged research
health; explicit host CLI.260 native PG tests; Docker/runtime imports and real loopback TLS
checks PASS. No real broker acceptance, durable recording or trading permission claimed.

## P2-003F — durable research archive — 2026-11-06T13:21:55Z

Schema0005 session/attempt/event lineage, strict canonical bounded JSON, atomic row-lock receipt
dedup/counters, serialized cancellation-safe writer, crash lease recovery, private paginated
reads and conservative sampled spans; CLI records by default.276 nativePG tests; Docker
persistence/private reads and localTLS regression PASS. All records synthetic; certified days0.

## P2-003G — reviewed calendar and sampled coverage — 2026-11-06T13:34:45Z

Official2026 FO calendar/timing/holiday amendment/special-session source hashes, explicit
unknown history/year states, conservative same-source per-key interval union, bounded private
read-only reports/CLI complete.301 nativePG tests; Docker evidence/private reads/persistence/
recovery PASS. No real broker capture or completed-day certification. All trading flags false.

## P2-003H — bounded multi-session supervision — 2026-11-06T13:56:30Z

Durable parent quota/stats ledger, linked child sessions, fresh catalog/grants, bounded rollover/
retry state, cooperative stop/cancellation-safe creation and lease recovery; private summaries/
CLI and schema0006.319 nativePG tests, Docker persistence and two-session real localTLS PASS.
No real account capture, auto-start or certified days. All trading flags false.

## P2-003I — safe operator preflight — 2026-11-06T14:09:13Z

Read-only local configuration/schema/table-grant/catalog/token-expiry/calendar/quota and active
record diagnostics; secret-free private API/CLI and supervisor preflight-only/blocked gating.
335 nativePG tests, Docker private diagnostics/no-record and localTLS regression PASS. Actual
host blocked:missing Analytics credential/unavailable DB. No schema/dependency/frontend change.

## 2026-11-06T14:26:00Z — P2-003J secure local runtime bootstrap

Implemented `scripts.bootstrap_local`: protected missing DB/admin credentials, Argon2 hash,
atomic mode0600 files, mode0700 runtime directory, local advisory lock, preservation of
existing secrets and settings, fail-closed conflict/link/existing-volume checks, Unix-socket
Docker restriction, private Compose startup and secret-free HTTP post-setup checks.
No new API, schema, dependency or frontend change. Head remains0006_capture_runs.

Actual persistent project `algotrade-ai-local` is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Readiness200, anonymous overview401, administrator login/private overview/preflight and CSRF
logout passed. `.env` and `.local/runtime/admin-password.txt` hold local protected settings;
never print or paste their contents. DB is private, application loopback-only. Actual app
preflight BLOCKED:CREDENTIAL_MISSING,CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED; database/schema/admin setup
now works. The earlier14:05 host report describes the pre-bootstrap state only. Generated
DATABASE_URL uses internal `db`; host CLI cannot directly reach this unpublished database.
No broker call, public metadata import, recording, strategy, order or phase promotion occurred.

Verification:348 passed against disposable PostgreSQL17.11/SCRAM/non-superuser; temporary
cluster stopped/removed. Default326 passed/22 PostgreSQL skipped. One upstream TestClient
warning.13 new bootstrap security cases. Ruff lint/format PASS83files, strict mypy PASS36
backendfiles, offline locked uv sync PASS. Persistent local deployment is distinct from the
disposable test DB. Previous same-day dependency audit retained; no dependency change.

Security:credentials never returned in safe CLI report or passed in argv; local plaintext
password file is not an encrypted vault. Existing hashes/DB passwords never reset. Existing
volume without credentials refuses generation. Private Compose initialization user has broad
DB privileges; production role separation/TLS/backup/retention/hardening remain pending.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live false, recording_startedfalse; genuine certified days0,
observation_started_at null. Real broker acceptance and calendar amendment proof unverified.
Next:P2-003K persistent public instrument metadata onboarding and connection-readiness guidance;
actual Analytics credential must be entered by the operator through local hidden helper only.

Actual repeat bootstrap: READY_LOCAL, administrator login verified again; .env and private
administrator password bytes unchanged. Both files mode0600; runtime directory0700.
Persistent application/database retained. Secret-pattern source/document/config scan:zero
findings; protected .env/.local excluded. No real broker request or recording started.
Changed files:scripts/bootstrap_local.py, tests/security/test_runtime_bootstrap.py,
docs/LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md, README.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md and relevant
verification/security/setup/preflight docs; all eight agent_memory handoff files. Operator
.env and .local/runtime generated locally and ignored, never included in source reports.

## 2026-11-06T14:29:38.704079+00:00 — P2-003K persistent metadata onboarding

Completed authorized public-source onboarding through the running app's existing admin API.

Read-only DB verification rehashed archived gzip, reparsed it through existing full validator,
matched normalized totals/type counts and confirmed exactly one snapshot. Nifty50/BankNifty
private lookups passed; anonymous access denied before login and after CSRF logout.
Observation sessions/events/capture runs remain0; global observation_started_at null.

Actual private preflight:BLOCKED only CREDENTIAL_MISSING. POSTGRESQL_REACHABLE, schema CURRENT

credential, authenticated broker request, grant/frame acceptance, market capture, quote/fill,
seven-day certification or trading activation. Entries/live/signals/execution remain false.
Tick units BROKER_UNVERIFIED; futures metadata conveys no trading permission. Static calendar
and broker/account access/production hardening limitations remain as previously recorded.
Public metadata download is distinct from authenticated broker-account access.

No runtime source/schema/dependency/UI change; reused existing validated import/diagnostics.
Files:docs/INSTRUMENT_MASTER.md, docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md, docs/LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md,
docs/CAPTURE_PREFLIGHT.md, docs/VERIFICATION.md, README.md, MASTER_PLAN.md and all eight

Protected .env/admin password unchanged; no secrets printed, collected or written to report.
Persistent project algotrade-ai-local remains running at http://127.0.0.1:8000; DB unpublished.
Checks:offline uv sync --locked PASS; default pytest326passed/22PGskipped, one upstream
TestClient warning; Ruff lint/format PASS83files; strict mypy PASS36backendfiles.
A read-only verification attempt initially used an unsupported Download constructor keyword;
corrected against actual source, rerun passed, no database mutation by either verification.
Next:P2-003L operator-local Analytics setup and explicit read-only connection acceptance.
Operator must enter credential/aware actual expiry through hidden local helper, never chat.
Do not launch capture automatically or claim an unperformed acceptance check.

Final P2-003K verification:full isolated PostgreSQL17.11 suite348passed/zero skips;
cluster stopped/removed; persistent operator DB retained. One upstream TestClient warning.
Source/document/config secret-pattern scan:139files,zero findings; .env/.local excluded.
No dependency/source change requiring additional build; running app remains unchanged.
Current operator blocker is only CREDENTIAL_MISSING; see docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md.

## 2026-11-06T14:32:03.002697+00:00 — P2-003L prerequisite check; acceptance pending

User requested next task. Inspected actual source, portable Git status and protected local
configuration without printing secret values. Analytics token and declared expiry are both
absent. Live authenticated app preflight at2026-11-06T14:31:48.392989Z:readiness200,
POSTGRESQL_REACHABLE, schema CURRENT0006_capture_runs, CURRENT_KEYS_RESOLVED and
TABLE_GRANTS_PRESENT; BLOCKED only CREDENTIAL_MISSING. Login/private diagnostic/CSRF logout
passed. No broker check requested because there is no credential. No settings/source/schema
change or capture; OBSERVATION, entries/live disabled. No actual broker acceptance claimed.
P2-003L remains pending operator-local input, not completed. Next exact action:operator runs
`uv run python -m scripts.configure_upstox` in the project directory and enters the actual
Analytics token hidden plus actual aware expiry, then runs
`uv run python -m scripts.bootstrap_local`. Never send credentials in chat. After reload,
verify explicit read-only probe and preflight; do not auto-start recording or promote phases.
Files changed:all eight agent_memory handoff records and docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md.
Verification:this turn's live local diagnostic above; no source change, full regression suite
not rerun. Prior348PGpass evidence remains historical. Persistent deployment/data preserved.

## 2026-11-06T14:49:54.812528+00:00 — P2-003M actual historical-candle acceptance

Operator configured Analytics token locally and reported exchange-status check passed.

Read-only private DB transaction rehashed canonical archive, matched every normalized bar,
verified OHLC bounds,5minute stride/duration and requested IST date. Anonymous status401,
admin login/import/stored batch read200 and CSRF logout204 passed. Local preflight passed
with zero blockers at import time. Operator expiry is a deliberately conservative local
cutoff2027-11-05T00:00:00+05:30 based on console date2027-11-06, not verified exact broker
expiry; previous missing-credential reports are historical. Never print token or expiry claims
as broker cryptographic validation. No token in report/argv/log output. Credentials unchanged.

No source/dependency/schema/UI change. Actual history saved in persistent local private DB;
ignored aggregate report:reports/local_history_acceptance.json. No repeat broker request.
Observation sessions/events/capture runs remain0. OBSERVATION; entries/live/signal/execution
false, observation_started_at null, qualifying days0. Historical import does not certify a
session, options-price dataset or completed day. Request-path identity only, historical
metadata unverifiable; calendar regular hours before review boundary unknown. No fabrication.
Real option-chain acceptance and streaming grant/frame acceptance remain unverified. Exchange
status success is operator-reported; agent's independent broker evidence is the history call.
An administrator password was exposed in chat earlier; do not reproduce it in records.
Rotation and old-session revocation remain a concrete security follow-up, not completed.

Checks this iteration:offline locked uv sync PASS; default pytest326passed/22PGskipped;
Ruff lint/format PASS83files; strict mypy PASS36backendfiles. One upstream TestClient warning.
Full disposable PG verification result recorded below after completion. Tests use synthetic
broker transports and disposable DB only; explicit real-data acceptance ran outside pytest.
Files:README.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, docs/HISTORICAL_CANDLES.md, CONNECTION_READINESS.md,
UPSTOX_SETUP.md, VERIFICATION.md and all eight agent_memory records. Head0006 unchanged.
Next:P2-003N rotate exposed local administrator credential, revoke prior sessions, preserve
broker credential/catalog/history and verify old-password rejection/new-login success.

Final P2-003M verification:full disposable PostgreSQL17.11 suite348passed/zero skips,
one upstream warning; temporary cluster stopped/removed, operator DB retained.
Secret-pattern scan:139source/document/config files,zero findings; protected operator
files excluded. Native tests and actual HTTP import/integrity evidence distinguish synthetic
regression coverage from real broker acceptance. No runtime source changes. Next:P2-003N.

## 2026-11-06T14:52:41.408698+00:00 — P2-003N administrator rotation COMPLETE

User explicitly authorized rotation of the administrator credential exposed in chat. One-time
local maintenance completed without printing/passing secrets in argv or reports. Stopped sole
app before session deletion; transactionally revoked4sessions, confirmed0, generated random
replacement/Argon2 hash, protected per-file atomic replacement of .env and local password,
then recreated app through existing bootstrap. Candidate password file removed after success.
Actual old-password POST401, pre-rotation cookie GET401, replacement login200/private GET200
and CSRF logout204. Bootstrap readiness/login/local preflight passed; zero blockers. Final
admin_sessions0. Password at .local/runtime/admin-password.txt, mode0600; .env0600, runtime0700.
Retrieve it only locally and sign in again; never reproduce the old/new password in records.

Verified unchanged parsed configuration except ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, including broker token,
expiry, DB credentials and OBSERVATION settings. Read-only DB manifests (counts plus row
fingerprints compared in memory, not logged) match before/after for catalogs/history/research
and schema revision. Retained1instrument snapshot,6504instruments,1history batch,75candles,

Checks:offline locked uv sync PASS; default326passed/22PGskipped, one upstream TestClient
warning; Ruff lint/format PASS83files; strict mypy PASS36backendfiles. Full disposable PG
result added below. Explicit rotation verification against operator runtime is distinct from
disposable regression tests; tests never contact actual broker accounts. No permanent reset

Files:docs/ADMIN_CREDENTIAL_ROTATION.md, LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md, SECURITY.md, VERIFICATION.md,
CONNECTION_READINESS.md, README.md and all eight agent_memory records. Protected operator
.env/password changed locally and remain ignored. Aggregate ignored report:reports/admin_rotation.json.
Remaining:local plaintext password storage/MFA/backups/production hardening; no encrypted
vault claim. Per-file atomic writes are not a transaction across both credential files.
