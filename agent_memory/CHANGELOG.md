# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-06, Codex / root
Objective: Phase 1 foundation only.
Added repository structure, FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/Alembic foundation, fail-closed configuration,
Argon2 administrator sessions, CSRF/origin checks, safe logging and headers, responsive vanilla
shell, Docker/Compose definitions, tests, locked environment, CI and operational documentation.
Verification: 27 pytest passed, 1 PostgreSQL skipped; Ruff/mypy pass; 63 dependency packages
with zero audit findings; Chrome responsive/theme/private-state smoke passed.
Security: no broker credentials or execution path; no production readiness claimed.
Mode: OBSERVATION; entries false; live execution unavailable.
Remaining: PostgreSQL/Docker runtime verification; next task P1-VERIFY.

## 0.1.0 verification iteration — 2026-11-06T11:09:08Z, Codex / root
Fixed textual LIVE_ENABLED=false startup parsing with environment regression tests. Added
four unique-schema PostgreSQL integration checks, a native disposable PostgreSQL harness,
a generated-credential isolated Compose smoke command and CI wiring. Compose accepts isolated
APP_ENV_FILE/APP_BIND_PORT overrides. Updated verification/security/setup/handoff documentation.
Actual results: PostgreSQL17.11 full suite41 passed; default37 passed/4 skipped; Ruff/mypy pass;
Compose config pass. Docker engine missing: container build/runtime checks not passed.
No dependency changes, system installations, broker credentials or execution added.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live disabled. Next: remaining Docker runtime P1-VERIFY gate.

## Phase 1 runtime verification complete — 2026-11-06T11:19:39Z, Codex / root
Confirmed Docker client/server 29.9.2 and Compose 5.6.1 after operator installation. Actual
image build and generated-credential isolated container smoke PASSED: migrations, readiness,
authentication, non-root UID 10001, app restart, database outage/recovery, CSRF/revocation and
absent execution routes. Temporary containers/volume removed; follow-up cleanup confirmed.
Ruff lint/format and mypy rerun successfully. No application/test/dependency changes; prior
41-test PostgreSQL result retained without unnecessary rerun. Updated documentation/memory.
P1-VERIFY closed. OBSERVATION; entries/live off. Next task P2-001 read-only broker docs review.

## Phase2 first read-only slice — 2026-11-06T11:37:45Z, Codex / root
Added official API/credential review, server Analytics credential+expiry validation, fixed-GET
Upstox exchange adapter, admin/CSRF manual probe, bounded error/rate handling, dashboard states,
hidden local secret setup and network-isolated synthetic broker tests. HTTPX became runtime
without a version change. Extended Docker smoke covers the new private/unconfigured routes.
Actual checks: native PostgreSQL72 tests pass; default68 pass/4 skip; Ruff/mypy/lock pass;
Docker extended smoke pass; Chrome synthetic login/probe/throttle/logout/responsive pass.
No real broker request, token, account balance, observation record or live permission created.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live off. Phase2 partial. Next:P2-003A instrument-master snapshots.

secure local runtime bootstrap, preserving secrets/settings.

## 2026-11-06T14:26:00Z — P2-003J secure local runtime bootstrap

Implemented `scripts.bootstrap_local`: protected missing DB/admin credentials, Argon2 hash,
atomic mode0600 files, mode0700 runtime directory, local advisory lock, preservation of
existing secrets and settings, fail-closed conflict/link/existing-volume checks, Unix-socket
Docker restriction, private Compose startup and secret-free HTTP post-setup checks.
No new API, schema, dependency or frontend change. Head remains0006_capture_runs.

Actual persistent project `algotrade-ai-local` is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Readiness200, anonymous overview401, administrator login/private overview/preflight and CSRF
logout passed. `.env` and `.local/runtime/admin-password.txt` hold local protected settings;
never print or paste their contents. DB is private, application loopback-only. Actual app
preflight BLOCKED:CREDENTIAL_MISSING,CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED; database/schema/admin setup
now works. The earlier14:05 host report describes the pre-bootstrap state only. Generated
DATABASE_URL uses internal `db`; host CLI cannot directly reach this unpublished database.
No broker call, public metadata import, recording, strategy, order or phase promotion occurred.

Verification:348 passed against disposable PostgreSQL17.11/SCRAM/non-superuser; temporary
cluster stopped/removed. Default326 passed/22 PostgreSQL skipped. One upstream TestClient
warning.13 new bootstrap security cases. Ruff lint/format PASS83files, strict mypy PASS36
backendfiles, offline locked uv sync PASS. Persistent local deployment is distinct from the
disposable test DB. Previous same-day dependency audit retained; no dependency change.

Security:credentials never returned in safe CLI report or passed in argv; local plaintext
password file is not an encrypted vault. Existing hashes/DB passwords never reset. Existing
volume without credentials refuses generation. Private Compose initialization user has broad
DB privileges; production role separation/TLS/backup/retention/hardening remain pending.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live false, recording_startedfalse; genuine certified days0,
observation_started_at null. Real broker acceptance and calendar amendment proof unverified.
Next:P2-003K persistent public instrument metadata onboarding and connection-readiness guidance;
actual Analytics credential must be entered by the operator through local hidden helper only.

Actual repeat bootstrap: READY_LOCAL, administrator login verified again; .env and private
administrator password bytes unchanged. Both files mode0600; runtime directory0700.
Persistent application/database retained. Secret-pattern source/document/config scan:zero
findings; protected .env/.local excluded. No real broker request or recording started.
Changed files:scripts/bootstrap_local.py, tests/security/test_runtime_bootstrap.py,
docs/LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md, README.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md and relevant
verification/security/setup/preflight docs; all eight agent_memory handoff files. Operator
.env and .local/runtime generated locally and ignored, never included in source reports.

## 2026-11-06T14:32:03.002697+00:00 — P2-003L prerequisite check; acceptance pending

User requested next task. Inspected actual source, portable Git status and protected local
configuration without printing secret values. Analytics token and declared expiry are both
absent. Live authenticated app preflight at2026-11-06T14:31:48.392989Z:readiness200,
POSTGRESQL_REACHABLE, schema CURRENT0006_capture_runs, CURRENT_KEYS_RESOLVED and
TABLE_GRANTS_PRESENT; BLOCKED only CREDENTIAL_MISSING. Login/private diagnostic/CSRF logout
passed. No broker check requested because there is no credential. No settings/source/schema
change or capture; OBSERVATION, entries/live disabled. No actual broker acceptance claimed.
P2-003L remains pending operator-local input, not completed. Next exact action:operator runs
`uv run python -m scripts.configure_upstox` in the project directory and enters the actual
Analytics token hidden plus actual aware expiry, then runs
`uv run python -m scripts.bootstrap_local`. Never send credentials in chat. After reload,
verify explicit read-only probe and preflight; do not auto-start recording or promote phases.
Files changed:all eight agent_memory handoff records and docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md.
Verification:this turn's live local diagnostic above; no source change, full regression suite
not rerun. Prior348PGpass evidence remains historical. Persistent deployment/data preserved.

## 2026-11-06T14:49:54.812528+00:00 — P2-003M actual historical-candle acceptance

Read-only private DB transaction rehashed canonical archive, matched every normalized bar,
verified OHLC bounds,5minute stride/duration and requested IST date. Anonymous status401,
admin login/import/stored batch read200 and CSRF logout204 passed. Local preflight passed
with zero blockers at import time. Operator expiry is a deliberately conservative local
cutoff2027-11-05T00:00:00+05:30 based on console date2027-11-06, not verified exact broker
expiry; previous missing-credential reports are historical. Never print token or expiry claims
as broker cryptographic validation. No token in report/argv/log output. Credentials unchanged.

No source/dependency/schema/UI change. Actual history saved in persistent local private DB;
ignored aggregate report:reports/local_history_acceptance.json. No repeat broker request.
Observation sessions/events/capture runs remain0. OBSERVATION; entries/live/signal/execution
false, observation_started_at null, qualifying days0. Historical import does not certify a
session, options-price dataset or completed day. Request-path identity only, historical
metadata unverifiable; calendar regular hours before review boundary unknown. No fabrication.
Real option-chain acceptance and streaming grant/frame acceptance remain unverified. Exchange
status success is operator-reported; agent's independent broker evidence is the history call.
An administrator password was exposed in chat earlier; do not reproduce it in records.
Rotation and old-session revocation remain a concrete security follow-up, not completed.

Checks this iteration:offline locked uv sync PASS; default pytest326passed/22PGskipped;

## 2026-11-06T14:52:41.408698+00:00 — P2-003N administrator rotation COMPLETE

User explicitly authorized rotation of the administrator credential exposed in chat. One-time
local maintenance completed without printing/passing secrets in argv or reports. Stopped sole
app before session deletion; transactionally revoked4sessions, confirmed0, generated random
replacement/Argon2 hash, protected per-file atomic replacement of .env and local password,
then recreated app through existing bootstrap. Candidate password file removed after success.
Actual old-password POST401, pre-rotation cookie GET401, replacement login200/private GET200
and CSRF logout204. Bootstrap readiness/login/local preflight passed; zero blockers. Final
admin_sessions0. Password at .local/runtime/admin-password.txt, mode0600; .env0600, runtime0700.
Retrieve it only locally and sign in again; never reproduce the old/new password in records.

Verified unchanged parsed configuration except ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, including broker token,
expiry, DB credentials and OBSERVATION settings. Read-only DB manifests (counts plus row

## 2026-11-06T17:53:39.936212+00:00 — CI-PG-PERM PostgreSQL permission regression fixed

Fixed CI-PG-PERM:CI superuser self-REVOKE did not remove effective INSERT. Added isolated

Existing code fix e108f1e retained;no extra application/test edits needed. Root cause is CI
superuser bypass of self-REVOKE;non-owner/non-superuser fixture and actual denial42501 already
correct it. Skip condition is absent TEST_POSTGRES_URL,not test success. Rechecked CI/config/

## 2026-11-06T18:36:59.271163+00:00 — P2-003R targeted status/cooperative stop implemented

Backend supervision_store adds request_capture_stop and read-only capture_stop_requested.
Request uses generated parentID validation,row lock/1s SQL timeouts and existing statsJSON
stop_requested_at;idempotent,closed/expired nonmutating,no schema migration or grants. Status
includes historical timestamp. Supervisor polls during active-child/rollover waits every0.5s
subject to DBlatency,uses existing cooperative cancellation/drain/finalize paths. No PID kill,
new HTTP mutation route,automatic recording or live permissions. Added scripts/control_capture.py;
scripts/capture_local.py supports --status[--capture-id] and --stop ID,verified local container
matching/no recording lock for controls. Initial stop acknowledgment is not final closure.

11new cases:synthetic active stop/rollover,target isolation,idempotence,closed/invalid/unknown

## 2026-11-06T18:44:21.685960+00:00 — P2-003S deterministic synthetic coverage fixtures COMPLETE

Root cause reproduced at fixed2026-11-06T18:29:58Z(23:59:58IST):old helper used wall-clock
recent observations but its synthetic session closed23:59;sampled union became0instead1000ms.
At ISTmidnight,independent date reads could also select a different date than recorded samples.
A temporary test-only clock harness first hit a module-alias mismatch;corrected it and verified
the exact original coverage assertion fails before changes and passes after at the same time.
No runtime guard,window or assertion was relaxed to obtain passing results.

Added opt-in coverage_clock fixture in tests/conftest.py with synthetic fixed instant
2026-11-06T06:30:00Z(noonIST). Only requesting tests' catalog/recording/coverage modules and
synthetic metadata builders receive restored-after-test datetime references. Authentication,
OS/system clock,production configuration and unrelated tests are not frozen. Coverage helpers

## 2026-11-06T19:04:02.904861+00:00 — P1-UI-AUDIT-A keyboard focus and control contrast

Official public catalog HEAD200 still publishes 2026-11-06T00:04:11Z while IST date is
2026-11-07; genuine active-stop acceptance P2-003R-A remains blocked. Took the existing
unblocked accessibility backlog item, scoped to keyboard focus/control borders/reflow.
Only runtime source changed: frontend/css/app.css. Added theme-specific focus/control-border
variables, sidebar focus color, explicit select/main focus, date-input :focus-within for
native date segments, and narrow-screen minmax(0,1fr)/connection-link wrapping. No text,
API, broker, freshness rule, database, credential or execution behavior changed.

Isolated Chrome CDP audit with synthetic form visibility and API401/no account connection:
1280px/320px × light/dark,18 distinct keyboard targets per scenario; skip-to-main and Enter
theme toggle PASS. Minimum focus contrast light5.51:1/dark7.90:1;input/select border
light3.40:1/dark4.98:1. No horizontal overflow. Original light focus2.16:1/border1.15:1;
original 320px content grid extended to342px; native date segments lost host focus-visible.
Audit harness initially needed page-target/load/key-event/transition corrections; corrected
checks exposed the actual date focus and layout defects and all final scenarios passed.
Safe aggregate:reports/dashboard_keyboard_audit.json; local harness under ignored.local.
Screen-reader/VoiceOver, authenticated dynamic announcements/errors, forced-colors/zoom and
complete WCAG audit remain pending; do not claim full AA conformance or P1-UI-AUDIT complete.

Next:P2-003R-A only when genuinely current metadata passes unchanged preflight; otherwise
continue the remaining documented accessibility checks without starting later trading phases.

Final verification (2026-11-06T19:04:39.712477+00:00 UTC): protected local bootstrap returned
READY_LOCAL with login verified, live/entries false and recording not started. The served
CSS matches the reviewed file byte-for-byte. Preflight still blocks CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED.
Gitleaks scanned all 30 pending files: zero new findings, one unchanged previously documented

## Phase 2 completion audit — 2026-11-09T14:19:02.977288+00:00 UTC

User requested all Phase2 work/checks. Status remains PARTIAL; do not claim whole-phase
completion. P2-003V initial observation report implemented and verified. Fresh385PGpassed/
0failed/0skipped;default361passed/24PGskips;one upstream warning. Ruff89files/mypy37files,
locked sync,TLS/supervision,pip-audit and isolated Docker build/restart/outage checks pass.
Hosted foundation/verify now confirmed SUCCESS on0f2df43 via run42630898094, including the
PostgreSQL test step. Earlier CI-unconfirmed statements are historical. New report code
has local checks only until an approved new commit/push/run. No commit or push this turn.

Actual private report exported to ignored reports/INITIAL_OBSERVATION.md (mode0600):
UPSTOX_V3,seven requested dates,zero matching derivative sessions,NOT_CERTIFIED. Existing
2index sessions/9events remain distinct. Report preserves bounds/hash validation, does not
write DB/contact broker/start capture/certify days. Runtime bootstrap readiness/login and
preflight pass;OBSERVATION/live off. See docs/PHASE2_ACCEPTANCE.md for exact evidence/gaps.

Remaining: OAuth implementation plus public registered client ID/callback and local secret;
genuine market-hours/reconnect evidence;actual seven-calendar-day observation window;
reviewed completion criteria and calendar/field-unit limitations. OAuth settings were asked
for;user replied with storage preference instead,so settings remain missing. Google Drive
(user reports5TB) selected as future backup/archive destination;PostgreSQL remains working
DB. No Drive connection/upload/migration/backup claimed;see docs/STORAGE.md.

Next: obtain non-secret Upstox client ID/exact callback,configure secret only locally;
implement/test OAuth. In an eligible reviewed market session,run finite genuine observation
with current metadata. Do not start Phase3,relax freshness or invent completed days.
Prior pending documentation changes preserved. No real broker request/new capture this
iteration;the genuine active-stop evidence belongs to the preceding9November task.

Final checks (2026-11-09T14:20:43.567215+00:00 UTC): all19changed/new files passed default-rule Gitleaks without

issues in five handoff records corrected. No index changes,commit,push or history rewrite.
Phase2 remains partial with explicit outstanding gates;Google Drive integration is planned,
not configured. Final runtime suite385PGpass/0skip;default361pass/24skip;one warning.

## 2026-11-09T14:48:12.940990+00:00 — Google Drive OAuth and cloud storage VERIFIED

Desktop credentials verified locally without printing values. Implemented Google's maintained
OAuth library with exactly drive.file,S256 PKCE,state validation and ephemeral127.0.0.1
callback. Browser consent succeeded after the user added the Google test account;earlier
attempts ended/cancelled without tokens. Access/refresh tokens now saved atomically in
.local/google/token.json,mode0600,directory0700. Ownership/symlinks/endpoints/client identity/
scopes checked;exclusive local lock,bounded waits/network requests and explicit reauthorization
preserve old tokens if new consent fails. URLs,codes,tokens and remote errors are withheld.

Actual Drive v3 acceptance:created AlgoTrade-AI-Storage (app archive),uploaded and downloaded
one generated synthetic JSON file,116bytes,with matching SHA256
c49d466f6d206233385ae269167bb218b3b980238a3900f51337e8041ca17a26. File retained. Metadata/parent/download capability checks passed.
Existing AlgoTrade-AI-Storage and all existing user files untouched. No delete/update/share
operation,project-file upload,DB export or automatic POST retry. Private receipt with IDs
and checksum is.local/google/storage-test.json(mode0600);nothing sensitive is staged.
PostgreSQL remains operational DB;Upstox/settings/live flags unchanged,OBSERVATION/live off.
Prior Drive-not-connected statements are superseded only for OAuth/synthetic round trip;
encrypted backup/export/restore/scheduling remain unimplemented.

23new synthetic security tests pass. Exact staged source snapshot:397passed/0failed/0skipped
with disposablePG17.11,including existing privilege checks. Candidate Ruff90files and strict
mypy38backendfiles pass. Full working tree:408passed/0failed/0skipped,including11earlier pending report cases
that are deliberately outside this commit. One upstream Starlette warning remains. Locked uv sync,
pip-audit(no known vulnerabilities),format and initial source secret scans passed.
Temporary PG clusters removed. New local commit is authorized;no push. Earlier pending

Next:review encrypted archive/database-export and isolated restore workflow before storing
sensitive backups;Google OAuth is separate from pending Upstox OAuth and Phase2 observation.

Final security verification:18staged files passed default-rule Gitleaks without ignores;actual Google credential/token values absent. Staged/working whitespace checks pass. Private Google files remain ignored;no push.

never a restore destination. Latest/per-file receipts become verified only after success;
failed verification preserves previous latest. Matching cached PostgreSQL image,key,receipt
and authorized Google access suffice for verify-latest;live app/DB is not consulted.

## 2026-11-09T15:46:17.476184+00:00 — Three-day cloud-first backups installed and checked

User requested backups every3days with minimal Mac storage and reported no offline recovery
copy. Installed per-user LaunchAgent com.algotrade-ai.cloud-backup,daily21:30IST due check.
Only when3IST calendar dates have elapsed since the last backup creation does it run the
existing encrypted upload/download/isolated-restore pipeline. Re-verifying an old backup
cannot postpone the due date. Next due12November2026 at21:30IST,subject to Mac/user/Docker
availability. No RunAtLoad backup,KeepAlive retry loop,broker startup or cloud retention
deletion. Host IST clock verified;changed timezone blocks and records scheduled execution.

Actual forced cloud-only job VERIFIED;new backup retained only on Drive,not as local
.atbackup. Legacy cache cleanup freshly downloaded/authenticated the matching cloud copy
before removing one exact app-owned local ciphertext,freeing4,870,741bytes. Keys,receipts,
unverified files,operational data and all Drive files preserved. Local cache now0archives.
Working PostgreSQL remains local;only small keys/metadata and runtime remain alongside it.
Source-aware cleanup/Drive calls reuse existing protected OAuth scope and local locks.

Installed job completed a real background check,exit0/SKIPPED_NOT_DUE. Initial10second
probe preceded completion;later private receipt/exit status verified execution. No unsupported
privacy/block conclusion. No extra backup during that check. Safe proof is ignored
.local/verification/schedule_acceptance.json. Job JSON is bounded/fixed-size;stdout/stderr
go to/dev/null and raw subprocess output is never copied to status. Actual attempts are
separate from skipped checks so failures stay visible. Overlap is locked;timeout requests
SIGINT only on its own child,allows cleanup grace and records pending cleanup instead of
SIGKILL. Installer refuses conflicting agents;disable refuses active jobs and removes only
its matching inactive agent. No global/root agent,cron,environment or Upstox changes.

## 2026-11-10T10:43:24.854270+00:00 — Passphrase-encrypted Drive recovery implementation

User explicitly selected an encrypted recovery kit on Drive. Added bounded Argon2id
(64MiB/3iterations/4lanes) and AES256GCM wrapping of the existing backup key plus a
projected verified backup receipt. Random salt/nonce; no Google/broker credentials bundled.
Create-only drive.file upload/download with metadata and SHA256 checks; original key remains
unchanged. Passphrase only in hidden local TTY/native prompts, never stored or passed in argv.
Cloud verification unwraps the downloaded kit and restores the downloaded backup into the
existing isolated, non-superuser, network-none disposable target. recover-local accepts
manually downloaded ciphertext without original key or Google credentials; no source restore.
Health distinguishes locally verified matching cloud kit from unconfirmed physical offline
copy; invalid optional receipts do not interrupt backup scheduling. No ciphertext cache.

21new synthetic cases;48combined recovery/schedule tests pass. Full working suite476passed,
0failed,0skipped with disposable PostgreSQL17.11. Ruff104files,format,strictmypy43backend
files and locked sync pass. One existing non-fatal Starlette warning remains. An initial
new test misused encrypt_dump return type; corrected the test and reran successfully.
Actual hidden-prompt attempt ended without creating a pending/verified receipt or uploading
a kit. Cloud acceptance remains pending operator passphrase entry; no verification claimed.
Prompt timeouts now return a fixed safe code, covered by a regression test. Exact staged checks/security/commit recorded separately.

Prior Phase2 changes remain separate. PostgreSQL stays operational,OBSERVATION/live disabled;
no Upstox change,new market capture,push,cloud deletion or production cutover.
Next:complete hidden prompts,verify actual Drive recovery,then resume eligible genuine
market-hours observation;Upstox OAuth/calendar/seven-day evidence gates remain incomplete.

Verification of the exact task-only staged snapshot:465PostgreSQL tests passed,0failed,
0skipped;Ruff101files/format and strictmypy42backendfiles passed. Working tree476passed
includes11earlier pending Phase2 tests excluded from this commit. One upstream warning
remains. All22staged files passed Gitleaks with no allowances and a private comparison
against locally configured credential/key values;full history passed with only the existing
two documented exact false-positive fingerprints. git diff --cached --check passed.
No secrets staged;no dependency,Upstox,live,production DB or schedule changes. Actual
cloud-kit creation/restore still requires the operator's hidden passphrase entry.
Exact next command: uv run python -m scripts.recovery_kit create (hidden terminal prompts),
then uv run python -m scripts.recovery_kit verify-cloud. Never send the passphrase in chat.

## 2026-11-10T11:11:55.103958+00:00 — Visible recovery prompt and independent Drive recovery VERIFIED

User could not see the earlier native prompt. Added explicit AppleScript activation and
a clear AlgoTrade AI Recovery title. User confirmed visibility. Creation now explicitly asks
for a NEW passphrase; verification explicitly asks for the SAME existing passphrase. Hidden
input remains captured only in memory, never argv/chat/logs/storage. Terminal fallback and
cancelling an outstanding dialog before switching are documented in RECOVERY_KIT.md.

First kit uploaded and creation-time isolated restore passed. Two independent passphrase
entries failed authentication; neither failure modified/deleted the kit or backup. User
explicitly requested another kit with a new independently kept passphrase. New914-byte kit
upload/download/decryption/isolated restore passed. A separate fresh hidden entry then
unlocked the stored new kit and restored its backup with the original local recovery_key
function explicitly patched to raise if read. That independent acceptance PASSED. No new
backup key,sourceDB restore,Google permission expansion or cloud deletion. Older kit retained.

One earlier full run475passed/1failed in existing test_tracker_duplicate_watermarks_and_trade_freshness;
isolated rerun and two later full runs passed. Inspection identifies a wall-clock millisecond
race:fixture message() samples a later datetime than captured now,then the test replaces the
generated watermark with earlier now and indexes observations after OUT_OF_ORDER. No feed
logic/assertions changed in this task;recorded as an unresolved flaky fixture,next action
use a deterministic synthetic clock in that test. Existing Starlette warning remains.

Files:scripts/recovery_kit.py,docs/RECOVERY_KIT.md,docs/VERIFICATION.md and all8agent_memory

Upstox credentials,operational PostgreSQL and existing Drive files preserved. No push.
Next:fix the documented feed fixture clock race,then resume Phase2 evidence gates.

## 2026-11-10T11:49:46.891948+00:00 — Feed fixture clock race fixed locally

Objective:resolve the intermittent duplicate/watermark/trade-freshness unit test failure.
Reproduced the original IndexError deterministically by advancing fixture clock1ms after
the test captured now. Frame generated_at then exceeded now;the existing production
OUT_OF_ORDER guard correctly returned no observations. Root cause was inconsistent
synthetic timestamps,not an application freshness or PostgreSQL permission defect.

Changed only tests/unit/test_feed_lifecycle.py:message/info fixture builders accept an
optional timestamp while preserving their default behavior for existing callers. The
regression uses one fixed aware UTC timestamp for protobuf and receipt times,parameterized
at0/999/999999microseconds. All duplicate,out-of-order,unknown-trade-time and high-watermark
assertions preserved. No skips,threshold relaxation,production source or dependency change.

Verification:27feed lifecycle tests passed;300direct executions of the three regression
cases passed with datetime.now forbidden. Full working suite478passed/0failed/0skipped
using disposable PostgreSQL17.11. Locked uv sync,Ruff104files/format and mypy43backendfiles
passed. Initial format check flagged a wrapped line;Ruff formatted it and final check passed.
Existing Starlette deprecation warning remains. Earlier reported fixture race is superseded
by this local fix;hosted CI for this new commit remains unverified until approved publication.
Exact task-only staged checks recorded below. Earlier pending Phase2 work kept separate.

Files:tests/unit/test_feed_lifecycle.py,docs/VERIFICATION.md and all8agent_memory files.
Security:only synthetic tests/docs changed,no broker/Drive request,credential access,
operational DB write,environment/settings change or live activation. OBSERVATION/live off.
Unfinished:Phase2 genuine market-session/observation,calendar and Upstox OAuth gates remain.
Next:review the next eligible market-hours observation acceptance and outstanding Phase2
evidence;do not claim completed observation days or new hosted CI success. No push.

Exact task-only staged snapshot:478PostgreSQL tests passed,0failed,0skipped;Ruff104files,
format and mypy43backendfiles passed. Earlier Phase2 work was independently committed
as a8dd32f during this iteration and is preserved;both working tree and candidate now
include it. Task diff remains only the fixture file and nine documentation files. All10
staged file contents passed Gitleaks without allowances;full history passed with existing
exact historical false-positive allowances. git diff --cached --check passed. No push.
