# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-06, Codex / root
Objective: Phase 1 foundation only.
Added repository structure, FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/Alembic foundation, fail-closed configuration,
Argon2 administrator sessions, CSRF/origin checks, safe logging and headers, responsive vanilla
shell, Docker/Compose definitions, tests, locked environment, CI and operational documentation.
Verification: 27 pytest passed, 1 PostgreSQL skipped; Ruff/mypy pass; 63 dependency packages
with zero audit findings; Chrome responsive/theme/private-state smoke passed.
Security: no broker credentials or execution path; no production readiness claimed.
Mode: OBSERVATION; entries false; live execution unavailable.
Remaining: PostgreSQL/Docker runtime verification; next task P1-VERIFY.

## 0.1.0 verification iteration — 2026-11-06T11:09:08Z, Codex / root
Fixed textual LIVE_ENABLED=false startup parsing with environment regression tests. Added
four unique-schema PostgreSQL integration checks, a native disposable PostgreSQL harness,
a generated-credential isolated Compose smoke command and CI wiring. Compose accepts isolated
APP_ENV_FILE/APP_BIND_PORT overrides. Updated verification/security/setup/handoff documentation.
Actual results: PostgreSQL17.11 full suite41 passed; default37 passed/4 skipped; Ruff/mypy pass;
Compose config pass. Docker engine missing: container build/runtime checks not passed.
No dependency changes, system installations, broker credentials or execution added.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live disabled. Next: remaining Docker runtime P1-VERIFY gate.

## Phase 1 runtime verification complete — 2026-11-06T11:19:39Z, Codex / root
Confirmed Docker client/server 29.9.2 and Compose 5.6.1 after operator installation. Actual
image build and generated-credential isolated container smoke PASSED: migrations, readiness,
authentication, non-root UID 10001, app restart, database outage/recovery, CSRF/revocation and
absent execution routes. Temporary containers/volume removed; follow-up cleanup confirmed.
Ruff lint/format and mypy rerun successfully. No application/test/dependency changes; prior
41-test PostgreSQL result retained without unnecessary rerun. Updated documentation/memory.
P1-VERIFY closed. OBSERVATION; entries/live off. Next task P2-001 read-only broker docs review.

## Phase2 first read-only slice — 2026-11-06T11:37:45Z, Codex / root
Added official API/credential review, server Analytics credential+expiry validation, fixed-GET
Upstox exchange adapter, admin/CSRF manual probe, bounded error/rate handling, dashboard states,
hidden local secret setup and network-isolated synthetic broker tests. HTTPX became runtime
without a version change. Extended Docker smoke covers the new private/unconfigured routes.
Actual checks: native PostgreSQL72 tests pass; default68 pass/4 skip; Ruff/mypy/lock pass;
Docker extended smoke pass; Chrome synthetic login/probe/throttle/logout/responsive pass.
No real broker request, token, account balance, observation record or live permission created.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live off. Phase2 partial. Next:P2-003A instrument-master snapshots.

secure local runtime bootstrap, preserving secrets/settings.

## 2026-11-06T14:26:00Z — P2-003J secure local runtime bootstrap

Implemented `scripts.bootstrap_local`: protected missing DB/admin credentials, Argon2 hash,
atomic mode0600 files, mode0700 runtime directory, local advisory lock, preservation of
existing secrets and settings, fail-closed conflict/link/existing-volume checks, Unix-socket
Docker restriction, private Compose startup and secret-free HTTP post-setup checks.
No new API, schema, dependency or frontend change. Head remains0006_capture_runs.

Actual persistent project `algotrade-ai-local` is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Readiness200, anonymous overview401, administrator login/private overview/preflight and CSRF
logout passed. `.env` and `.local/runtime/admin-password.txt` hold local protected settings;
never print or paste their contents. DB is private, application loopback-only. Actual app
preflight BLOCKED:CREDENTIAL_MISSING,CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED; database/schema/admin setup
now works. The earlier14:05 host report describes the pre-bootstrap state only. Generated
DATABASE_URL uses internal `db`; host CLI cannot directly reach this unpublished database.
No broker call, public metadata import, recording, strategy, order or phase promotion occurred.

Verification:348 passed against disposable PostgreSQL17.11/SCRAM/non-superuser; temporary
cluster stopped/removed. Default326 passed/22 PostgreSQL skipped. One upstream TestClient
warning.13 new bootstrap security cases. Ruff lint/format PASS83files, strict mypy PASS36
backendfiles, offline locked uv sync PASS. Persistent local deployment is distinct from the
disposable test DB. Previous same-day dependency audit retained; no dependency change.

Security:credentials never returned in safe CLI report or passed in argv; local plaintext
password file is not an encrypted vault. Existing hashes/DB passwords never reset. Existing
volume without credentials refuses generation. Private Compose initialization user has broad
DB privileges; production role separation/TLS/backup/retention/hardening remain pending.
Mode OBSERVATION; entries/live false, recording_startedfalse; genuine certified days0,
observation_started_at null. Real broker acceptance and calendar amendment proof unverified.
Next:P2-003K persistent public instrument metadata onboarding and connection-readiness guidance;
actual Analytics credential must be entered by the operator through local hidden helper only.

Actual repeat bootstrap: READY_LOCAL, administrator login verified again; .env and private
administrator password bytes unchanged. Both files mode0600; runtime directory0700.
Persistent application/database retained. Secret-pattern source/document/config scan:zero
findings; protected .env/.local excluded. No real broker request or recording started.
Changed files:scripts/bootstrap_local.py, tests/security/test_runtime_bootstrap.py,
docs/LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md, README.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md and relevant
verification/security/setup/preflight docs; all eight agent_memory handoff files. Operator
.env and .local/runtime generated locally and ignored, never included in source reports.

## 2026-11-06T14:32:03.002697+00:00 — P2-003L prerequisite check; acceptance pending

User requested next task. Inspected actual source, portable Git status and protected local
configuration without printing secret values. Analytics token and declared expiry are both
absent. Live authenticated app preflight at2026-11-06T14:31:48.392989Z:readiness200,
POSTGRESQL_REACHABLE, schema CURRENT0006_capture_runs, CURRENT_KEYS_RESOLVED and
TABLE_GRANTS_PRESENT; BLOCKED only CREDENTIAL_MISSING. Login/private diagnostic/CSRF logout
passed. No broker check requested because there is no credential. No settings/source/schema
change or capture; OBSERVATION, entries/live disabled. No actual broker acceptance claimed.
P2-003L remains pending operator-local input, not completed. Next exact action:operator runs
`uv run python -m scripts.configure_upstox` in the project directory and enters the actual
Analytics token hidden plus actual aware expiry, then runs
`uv run python -m scripts.bootstrap_local`. Never send credentials in chat. After reload,
verify explicit read-only probe and preflight; do not auto-start recording or promote phases.
Files changed:all eight agent_memory handoff records and docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md.
Verification:this turn's live local diagnostic above; no source change, full regression suite
not rerun. Prior348PGpass evidence remains historical. Persistent deployment/data preserved.

## 2026-11-06T14:49:54.812528+00:00 — P2-003M actual historical-candle acceptance

Read-only private DB transaction rehashed canonical archive, matched every normalized bar,
verified OHLC bounds,5minute stride/duration and requested IST date. Anonymous status401,
admin login/import/stored batch read200 and CSRF logout204 passed. Local preflight passed
with zero blockers at import time. Operator expiry is a deliberately conservative local
cutoff2027-11-05T00:00:00+05:30 based on console date2027-11-06, not verified exact broker
expiry; previous missing-credential reports are historical. Never print token or expiry claims
as broker cryptographic validation. No token in report/argv/log output. Credentials unchanged.

No source/dependency/schema/UI change. Actual history saved in persistent local private DB;
ignored aggregate report:reports/local_history_acceptance.json. No repeat broker request.
Observation sessions/events/capture runs remain0. OBSERVATION; entries/live/signal/execution
false, observation_started_at null, qualifying days0. Historical import does not certify a
session, options-price dataset or completed day. Request-path identity only, historical
metadata unverifiable; calendar regular hours before review boundary unknown. No fabrication.
Real option-chain acceptance and streaming grant/frame acceptance remain unverified. Exchange
status success is operator-reported; agent's independent broker evidence is the history call.
An administrator password was exposed in chat earlier; do not reproduce it in records.
Rotation and old-session revocation remain a concrete security follow-up, not completed.

Checks this iteration:offline locked uv sync PASS; default pytest326passed/22PGskipped;

## 2026-11-06T14:52:41.408698+00:00 — P2-003N administrator rotation COMPLETE

User explicitly authorized rotation of the administrator credential exposed in chat. One-time
local maintenance completed without printing/passing secrets in argv or reports. Stopped sole
app before session deletion; transactionally revoked4sessions, confirmed0, generated random
replacement/Argon2 hash, protected per-file atomic replacement of .env and local password,
then recreated app through existing bootstrap. Candidate password file removed after success.
Actual old-password POST401, pre-rotation cookie GET401, replacement login200/private GET200
and CSRF logout204. Bootstrap readiness/login/local preflight passed; zero blockers. Final
admin_sessions0. Password at .local/runtime/admin-password.txt, mode0600; .env0600, runtime0700.
Retrieve it only locally and sign in again; never reproduce the old/new password in records.

Verified unchanged parsed configuration except ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, including broker token,
expiry, DB credentials and OBSERVATION settings. Read-only DB manifests (counts plus row

## 2026-11-06T17:53:39.936212+00:00 — CI-PG-PERM PostgreSQL permission regression fixed

Fixed CI-PG-PERM:CI superuser self-REVOKE did not remove effective INSERT. Added isolated
non-owner/non-superuser permission fixture,actual denied INSERT check,and precise blocker
assertions. Native disposable harness permits fixture role creation;runtime checks unchanged.
Target1pass;full348pass on Docker17.6/native17.11;uv lint/format/mypy pass. Temporary grants/
roles/databases cleaned;no operator credentials/data or trading changes. Local commit
requested;no push. See docs/VERIFICATION.md and TEST_PLAN.md.

## 2026-11-06T18:00:37.861532+00:00 — PostgreSQL CI fix recheck; passed vs skipped clarified

Existing code fix e108f1e retained;no extra application/test edits needed. Root cause is CI
superuser bypass of self-REVOKE;non-owner/non-superuser fixture and actual denial42501 already
correct it. Skip condition is absent TEST_POSTGRES_URL,not test success. Rechecked CI/config/
migrations/preflight and reproduced old failure from isolated pre-fix archive without changing
working code/history. Fresh disposable Compose17.6:target1pass,PGtests22pass,full348pass;all
0skips. Default without PG:326pass/22skip. Original legacy target1expected failure reproduced.
Locked sync/Ruff lint/format/mypy pass;one upstream TestClient warning per run. No weakened
assertion,skip addition or runtime/security change. Cleanup queried0roles/0schemas,then removed
only unique test Compose project/legacy archive/test credentials. Operator DB,Upstox and.env
untouched;OBSERVATION/live off. Changes:TEST_PLAN/VERIFICATION and all8handoff records only.
Next:review local documentation verification commit alongside code commit e108f1e,approve
push before hosted CI rerun. No push/force-push/history rewrite. Functional nextP2-003Q.
