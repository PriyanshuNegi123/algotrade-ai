# Local connection readiness

Latest2026-11-06:operator credential configured; private preflight passed and an actual
75-bar historical import succeeded. Earlier missing-token diagnostics below are historical.
See the latest acceptance record at the end; option-chain/streaming remain unverified.

Verified2026-11-06 at14:27:56UTC (19:57:56IST). Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 with Docker
Desktop running. Retrieve the local administrator password from
`.local/runtime/admin-password.txt`; do not paste its contents into chat.

The persistent private database contains one validated official public NSE catalog:
83,940 source records,6,504 normalized records (139 indices,3,165 calls,3,182 puts,18 futures).

The persisted archive was rehashed/revalidated in a read-only transaction; stored row/type
counts match. Nifty50 and BankNifty lookups passed. See INSTRUMENT_MASTER.md for provenance,
validation bounds and currentness policy. CURRENT_METADATA describes that verification time;
future checks may require a fresh explicit dashboard import. Metadata is not executable quotes.

Authenticated capture preflight confirmed reachable PostgreSQL, current schema0006, current
requested index key and table grants. Its remaining blocker is CREDENTIAL_MISSING. There are
no observation sessions/events/capture runs; the global observation clock has not started.
No real authenticated broker call has been made. OBSERVATION remains active; all trading
permissions are false. Calendar baseline and broker acceptance warnings remain unresolved.

## Operator-local credential step

From the project directory, enter your actual read-only Analytics credential and its actual
broker-declared, timezone-aware expiry in the local prompts:

```sh
uv run python -m scripts.configure_upstox
uv run python -m scripts.bootstrap_local
```

The credential prompt is hidden. Never send the credential in chat, command arguments,
screenshots or browser forms. The bootstrap reloads local settings while preserving the
existing DB/admin credentials and persistent catalog; it does not call the broker or start
capture. A locally declared expiry does not prove broker acceptance or entitlement.

Sign in and explicitly choose **Check read-only connection**. This performs the implemented
restricted exchange-status request; record the actual result. A successful probe still does
not prove feed authorization, history/chain entitlement, market coverage or trading permission.
An absent/expired/wrong credential must remain blocked; do not invent substitute data or scope.
Authenticated GET /api/observations/preflight with requested instrument keys can then be checked
again (see CAPTURE_PREFLIGHT.md). Capture requires a separate explicit, bounded operator action;
this iteration does not start it, schedule it or certify an observation day.

The generated DATABASE_URL uses internal hostname `db`; host database CLIs cannot reach that
unpublished Compose service. Use authenticated app controls, or a reviewed internal-container
workflow. Do not expose the DB port to work around this boundary. Existing host capture CLIs
need an appropriate protected internal runtime workflow before use with this deployment.
Production security, backups, retention, role separation and genuine observation evidence
remain pending. No strategy, simulator or execution phase is authorized by readiness.

## 2026-11-06T14:32:03.002697+00:00 — P2-003L prerequisite check; acceptance pending

User requested next task. Inspected actual source, portable Git status and protected local
configuration without printing secret values. Analytics token and declared expiry are both
absent. Live authenticated app preflight at2026-11-06T14:31:48.392989Z:readiness200,
POSTGRESQL_REACHABLE, schema CURRENT0006_capture_runs, CURRENT_KEYS_RESOLVED and
TABLE_GRANTS_PRESENT; BLOCKED only CREDENTIAL_MISSING. Login/private diagnostic/CSRF logout
passed. No broker check requested because there is no credential. No settings/source/schema
change or capture; OBSERVATION, entries/live disabled. No actual broker acceptance claimed.
P2-003L remains pending operator-local input, not completed. Next exact action:operator runs
`uv run python -m scripts.configure_upstox` in the project directory and enters the actual
Analytics token hidden plus actual aware expiry, then runs
`uv run python -m scripts.bootstrap_local`. Never send credentials in chat. After reload,
verify explicit read-only probe and preflight; do not auto-start recording or promote phases.
Files changed:all eight agent_memory handoff records and docs/CONNECTION_READINESS.md.
Verification:this turn's live local diagnostic above; no source change, full regression suite
not rerun. Prior348PGpass evidence remains historical. Persistent deployment/data preserved.

Read-only private DB transaction rehashed canonical archive, matched every normalized bar,
verified OHLC bounds,5minute stride/duration and requested IST date. Anonymous status401,
admin login/import/stored batch read200 and CSRF logout204 passed. Local preflight passed
with zero blockers at import time. Operator expiry is a deliberately conservative local
cutoff2027-11-05T00:00:00+05:30 based on console date2027-11-06, not verified exact broker
expiry; previous missing-credential reports are historical. Never print token or expiry claims
as broker cryptographic validation. No token in report/argv/log output. Credentials unchanged.

No source/dependency/schema/UI change. Actual history saved in persistent local private DB;
ignored aggregate report:reports/local_history_acceptance.json. No repeat broker request.
Observation sessions/events/capture runs remain0. OBSERVATION; entries/live/signal/execution
false, observation_started_at null, qualifying days0. Historical import does not certify a
session, options-price dataset or completed day. Request-path identity only, historical
metadata unverifiable; calendar regular hours before review boundary unknown. No fabrication.
Real option-chain acceptance and streaming grant/frame acceptance remain unverified. Exchange
status success is operator-reported; agent's independent broker evidence is the history call.
An administrator password was exposed in chat earlier; do not reproduce it in records.
Rotation and old-session revocation remain a concrete security follow-up, not completed.

Checks this iteration:offline locked uv sync PASS; default pytest326passed/22PGskipped;
Ruff lint/format PASS83files; strict mypy PASS36backendfiles. One upstream TestClient warning.
Full disposable PG verification result recorded below after completion. Tests use synthetic
broker transports and disposable DB only; explicit real-data acceptance ran outside pytest.

broker credential/catalog/history and verify old-password rejection/new-login success.

## 2026-11-06T14:52:41.408698+00:00 — P2-003N administrator rotation COMPLETE

User explicitly authorized rotation of the administrator credential exposed in chat. One-time
local maintenance completed without printing/passing secrets in argv or reports. Stopped sole
app before session deletion; transactionally revoked4sessions, confirmed0, generated random
replacement/Argon2 hash, protected per-file atomic replacement of .env and local password,
then recreated app through existing bootstrap. Candidate password file removed after success.
Actual old-password POST401, pre-rotation cookie GET401, replacement login200/private GET200
and CSRF logout204. Bootstrap readiness/login/local preflight passed; zero blockers. Final
admin_sessions0. Password at .local/runtime/admin-password.txt, mode0600; .env0600, runtime0700.
Retrieve it only locally and sign in again; never reproduce the old/new password in records.

Verified unchanged parsed configuration except ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, including broker token,
expiry, DB credentials and OBSERVATION settings. Read-only DB manifests (counts plus row
fingerprints compared in memory, not logged) match before/after for catalogs/history/research
and schema revision. Retained1instrument snapshot,6504instruments,1history batch,75candles,

Checks:offline locked uv sync PASS; default326passed/22PGskipped, one upstream TestClient
warning; Ruff lint/format PASS83files; strict mypy PASS36backendfiles. Full disposable PG
result added below. Explicit rotation verification against operator runtime is distinct from
disposable regression tests; tests never contact actual broker accounts. No permanent reset
