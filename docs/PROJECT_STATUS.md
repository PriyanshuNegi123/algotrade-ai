# Project status and next steps

## 2026-11-10T13:40:58.086070+00:00 — Public instrument catalog refreshed and verified

Objective:remove the stale-catalog blocker before the next eligible Phase2 market-hours
attempt. Used the existing scripts.sync_instruments source inside the uniquely verified
private app container,under the existing bootstrap lock. Only the fixed official public
NSE master was fetched;no Analytics token request,broker account call or recording.
Existing bounded source/decompression/schema/expiry/underlying checks and atomic immutable
archive logic were reused without changing production source or freshness policy.

Actual import:CURRENT_METADATA,6744selected instruments from85462source records;
new immutable snapshot,deduplicated=false. Source Last-Modified2026-11-09T23:57:32Z
is10November05:27:32IST,so it correctly meets the existing current-IST-date rule.
Raw gzip SHA256 verified,normalized row count matches receipt. Before/after hashes prove
all prior raw/normalized catalogs and every existing candle import/candle,chain snapshot/
leg,capture/session/event row unchanged. Only new catalog/supported metadata rows added.
No plaintext download/cache file retained;PostgreSQL remains the operational store.

After refresh,the read-only market-session check has only NO_REVIEWED_SESSION:the reviewed
baseline marks10November2026 HOLIDAY. CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED is resolved at this check;
currentness must be reevaluated on the next attempt/date. No automatic recording,scheduling,
new market/reconnect evidence,observation-day certification or Phase2 completion claimed.
Safe receipts ignored/private at.local/verification/catalog_refresh_acceptance.json and
catalog_refresh_readiness.json. Credentials,environment,cloud files and backup job unchanged.

Checks:full disposable PostgreSQL17.11 suite503passed/0failed/0skipped;locked sync,
Ruff107files/format and mypy44backendfiles pass. One existing Starlette warning remains.
No new implementation/tests required for this operational use of the existing verified
importer. Security/whitespace and local documentation commit results recorded below.
Files:all8agent_memory records,docs/VERIFICATION.md,PHASE2_ACCEPTANCE.md,PROJECT_STATUS.md
and MARKET_SESSION_CHECK.md. OBSERVATION/live disabled. No push.
Next:before an eligible reviewed session,recheck catalog/readiness with an explicit supported
option and perform bounded genuine fresh-update/reconnect acceptance. If outside a session,
continue Upstox OAuth onboarding;public registered client ID/exact callback still required,
secret stays local. Seven-day observation and calendar/unit gates remain incomplete.


## Phase 2 completion audit — 2026-11-09T14:19:02.977288+00:00 UTC

User requested all Phase2 work/checks. Status remains PARTIAL; do not claim whole-phase
completion. P2-003V initial observation report implemented and verified. Fresh385PGpassed/
0failed/0skipped;default361passed/24PGskips;one upstream warning. Ruff89files/mypy37files,
locked sync,TLS/supervision,pip-audit and isolated Docker build/restart/outage checks pass.
Hosted foundation/verify now confirmed SUCCESS on0f2df43 via run42630898094, including the
PostgreSQL test step. Earlier CI-unconfirmed statements are historical. New report code
has local checks only until an approved new commit/push/run. No commit or push this turn.

Actual private report exported to ignored reports/INITIAL_OBSERVATION.md (mode0600):
UPSTOX_V3,seven requested dates,zero matching derivative sessions,NOT_CERTIFIED. Existing
2index sessions/9events remain distinct. Report preserves bounds/hash validation, does not
write DB/contact broker/start capture/certify days. Runtime bootstrap readiness/login and
preflight pass;OBSERVATION/live off. See docs/PHASE2_ACCEPTANCE.md for exact evidence/gaps.

Remaining: OAuth implementation plus public registered client ID/callback and local secret;
genuine market-hours/reconnect evidence;actual seven-calendar-day observation window;
reviewed completion criteria and calendar/field-unit limitations. OAuth settings were asked
for;user replied with storage preference instead,so settings remain missing. Google Drive
(user reports5TB) selected as future backup/archive destination;PostgreSQL remains working
DB. No Drive connection/upload/migration/backup claimed;see docs/STORAGE.md.

Next: obtain non-secret Upstox client ID/exact callback,configure secret only locally;
implement/test OAuth. In an eligible reviewed market session,run finite genuine observation
with current metadata. Do not start Phase3,relax freshness or invent completed days.
Prior pending documentation changes preserved. No real broker request/new capture this
iteration;the genuine active-stop evidence belongs to the preceding9November task.


Updated: 2026-11-09T14:05:58.802923+00:00 UTC. Phase1 complete; Phase2 partial; genuine active-stop verified; hosted CI unconfirmed.

## What is complete

|---|---|---|
| Foundation | FastAPI/PostgreSQL/Alembic, vanilla dashboard, administrator authentication, CSRF/origin checks, fail-closed permissions | Production hardening and accessibility audit remain pending |
| Local deployment | Protected bootstrap, private database, loopback-only app, migration head0006_capture_runs | Keep Docker Desktop running; do not delete the persistent volume |
| Public instrument catalog | Two real source archives; latest6,810 selected instruments from84,868 source records; checksum/catalog lookups verified | Currentness must be checked again before future broker work |
| Historical candles |75 real Nifty50 five-minute bars for5November2026; canonical checksum, prices and time spacing verified | Not certified session coverage, option fills or an observation day |
| Option chain | One real Nifty50 snapshot for9November2026 expiry;135strikes/270legs; archive/catalog/pagination verified |72legs flagged; quote freshness UNKNOWN; Greek units unverified |

| Administrator security | Exposed local admin password replaced;4prior sessions revoked; old password/session rejection and new login verified | Retrieve replacement only locally; never paste it into chat |
| Formatting | HTML trailing whitespace/line endings cleaned;10Markdown breaks preserved; dependent checksums updated with approval | Calendar timing/holiday values and functionality unchanged |
| Gitleaks | Two verified false positives documented; exactly two historical fingerprints allowed | No broad rule/path/commit exclusions; not a general security certification |

Detailed evidence:[history](HISTORICAL_CANDLES.md),[chain](OPTION_CHAIN.md),
[calendar](CALENDAR_COVERAGE.md),[Gitleaks](GITLEAKS_REVIEW.md),
[password rotation](ADMIN_CREDENTIAL_ROTATION.md),[runtime setup](LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md).

## Current safety and verification state

- OBSERVATION; entries, live trading, signals and execution remain disabled. No order adapter.
- Last verified persistent data:2catalogs/latest6,810instruments,1history batch/75candles,
  1chain snapshot/270legs. Now2streaming sessions/9events/2capture runs,all closed. No genuine
  completed observation day or seven-day certification. Counts were verified after the 9 November active-stop acceptance; one new parent/child and3events were added.
- Local app URL:http://127.0.0.1:8000. Administrator password stays in
  `.local/runtime/admin-password.txt`; broker token stays in protected local settings.
  The private database hostname `db` is internal to Compose, not reachable by host DB CLIs.
- The Analytics expiry configured locally is a deliberately early cutoff based on the
  console date; it is not an independently verified exact broker expiry timestamp.
- Latest full disposable PostgreSQL suite:374passed; default351passed/23PGskipped;
  Ruff lint/format and strict mypy passed previously. One upstream TestClient warning.
  Latest fresh run:374PGpass/0fail/0skip;lint/type checks passed. Default351pass/23skip is prior evidence, not rerun this iteration.
- Current Git HEAD:`0f2df43`;9reachable local commits. Full-history Gitleaks8.30.1
  rerun this update:exit0,zero unallowed findings,with2exact reviewed fingerprints.
  The previous statement that there was only1commit is historical. No commit/push by this agent.

## What to do next: development

**P2-003U: bounded genuine market-hours observation acceptance.**

P2-003R-A completed on9November: current catalog imported, local preflight passed,
one Nifty50 snapshot received and the exact active parent stopped cooperatively. Parent
and child closed; active HTTPS transport disappeared; hashes/private reads verified.
The stale quote contributes0sampled milliseconds and0qualifying days. The prior catalog
blocker is resolved for this verification time only; recheck before future capture.

Next, during a reviewed eligible session, validate a supported explicit catalog contract,
then perform a bounded genuine observation and verify recent updates/sample lineage.
No automatic recording or invented day certification. Keep all trading flags disabled.

After durable recording verification, proceed with deliberately bounded genuine observation and honest
coverage reports. Research/strategies/backtesting/paper execution remain later phases under
the project brief; do not skip to them based on API acceptance or calendar days passing.

## What to do next: before any public push

1. Review these documentation changes and make a normal follow-up commit when authorized.
   Do not use add-all blindly; confirm real environment/password/report files remain excluded.
2. Check the final staged diff and whitespace, then rescan the complete final history:

```sh
git diff --cached --check
gitleaks git --log-opts="--all --full-history" --redact=100 --no-banner .
```

If this terminal cannot find Gitleaks, its verified local executable is
`/opt/homebrew/bin/gitleaks`. Require exit0 with no unreviewed findings. Ensure full history
and the reviewed .gitleaksignore are used, without inherited config/rule overrides.
3. No rotation or history cleanup is needed for the two reviewed false positives. New actual
   secrets require rotation and a separately approved history-cleaning plan before publication.
4. Public push still requires the user's instruction. No push, force-push or history rewrite
   is authorized or performed by this status update. Remote publication state was not inspected.

Remaining wider gates:OAuth/account coordination, calendar amendment completeness, actual
streaming/observation evidence, accessibility, MFA/production secrets, backups/restore,
retention, image scanning and all later strategy/paper/compliance/production phases.

## 2026-11-06T15:52:35.233597+00:00 — P2-003P bounded real streaming acceptance COMPLETE

Explicitly authorized live-broker acceptance outside pytest. One Nifty50 index-only LTPC

Both loaders validate; all parsed policy fields excluding evidence hashes compared identical.
This provenance-only difference reflects approved whitespace cleanup; no market hours changed.
Before durable deployment verification rebuild via existing protected bootstrap so the current
reviewed manifests are deployed. Never relax integrity checks or alter calendar times to pass.

WEBSOCKET_FEED.md,FEED_LIFECYCLE.md,CONNECTION_READINESS.md,VERIFICATION.md and all8agent_memory
records. Existing Git state preserved; no staging,commit,push,force-push or history rewrite.
Next:P2-003Q reproducible bounded durable capture workflow inside private Compose runtime,
rebuild reviewed image,verify persisted events/stop status/quotas without fabricating days.
Fresh market-hours observations and longer coverage still need explicit reviewed runs.


## 2026-11-06T18:23:41.007699+00:00 — P2-003Q durable local capture verified

P2-003Q verified:private Docker wrapper scripts/capture_local.py reuses existing preflight/

## 2026-11-06T18:36:59.271163+00:00 — P2-003R targeted status/cooperative stop implemented

Backend supervision_store adds request_capture_stop and read-only capture_stop_requested.
Request uses generated parentID validation,row lock/1s SQL timeouts and existing statsJSON
stop_requested_at;idempotent,closed/expired nonmutating,no schema migration or grants. Status
includes historical timestamp. Supervisor polls during active-child/rollover waits every0.5s
subject to DBlatency,uses existing cooperative cancellation/drain/finalize paths. No PID kill,
new HTTP mutation route,automatic recording or live permissions. Added scripts/control_capture.py;
scripts/capture_local.py supports --status[--capture-id] and --stop ID,verified local container
matching/no recording lock for controls. Initial stop acknowledgment is not final closure.

11new cases:synthetic active stop/rollover,target isolation,idempotence,closed/invalid/unknown

## 2026-11-06T18:44:21.685960+00:00 — P2-003S deterministic synthetic coverage fixtures COMPLETE

Root cause reproduced at fixed2026-11-06T18:29:58Z(23:59:58IST):old helper used wall-clock
recent observations but its synthetic session closed23:59;sampled union became0instead1000ms.
At ISTmidnight,independent date reads could also select a different date than recorded samples.
A temporary test-only clock harness first hit a module-alias mismatch;corrected it and verified
the exact original coverage assertion fails before changes and passes after at the same time.
No runtime guard,window or assertion was relaxed to obtain passing results.

Added opt-in coverage_clock fixture in tests/conftest.py with synthetic fixed instant
2026-11-06T06:30:00Z(noonIST). Only requesting tests' catalog/recording/coverage modules and
synthetic metadata builders receive restored-after-test datetime references. Authentication,
OS/system clock,production configuration and unrelated tests are not frozen. Coverage helpers
use the same explicit instant for calendar/request/base;two PostgreSQL coverage consumers now
request this fixture.4regression cases poison helper wall-clock at23:59:58,23:59:59.999999,

No staging/commit/push/history rewrite. OBSERVATION/live disabled retained.
Next:P2-003R-A recheck official catalog freshness then genuine active-broker stop acceptance
only if preflight passes;last operator report blocked CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED. Do not bypass
freshness/closed-market gates or certify a day from snapshots. Longer observation still pending.


## 2026-11-06T18:54:19.871509+00:00 — P2-003T read-only catalog freshness diagnostics COMPLETE

Official source HEAD still advertises2026-11-06T00:04:11Z while ISTtoday2026-11-07;
P2-003R-A genuine active-stop remains blocked. Continued unblocked Phase2 work:preflight
now adds a catalog context from the same read-only DB snapshot/order as feed resolution.
Fields:existence state,snapshotID,source publication UTC/ISTdate,retrieval/import timestamps,
checked ISTdate and existing metadata gate_result. No policy thresholds,permissions,fetch,

Next:continue P2-003R-A only after a genuinely current catalog passes existing gates;do not
reimport identical stale content to fake publication/currentness or auto-schedule recording.

## 2026-11-06T19:04:02.904861+00:00 — P1-UI-AUDIT-A keyboard focus and control contrast

Official public catalog HEAD200 still publishes 2026-11-06T00:04:11Z while IST date is
2026-11-07; genuine active-stop acceptance P2-003R-A remains blocked. Took the existing
unblocked accessibility backlog item, scoped to keyboard focus/control borders/reflow.
Only runtime source changed: frontend/css/app.css. Added theme-specific focus/control-border
variables, sidebar focus color, explicit select/main focus, date-input :focus-within for
native date segments, and narrow-screen minmax(0,1fr)/connection-link wrapping. No text,
API, broker, freshness rule, database, credential or execution behavior changed.

Isolated Chrome CDP audit with synthetic form visibility and API401/no account connection:
1280px/320px × light/dark,18 distinct keyboard targets per scenario; skip-to-main and Enter
theme toggle PASS. Minimum focus contrast light5.51:1/dark7.90:1;input/select border
light3.40:1/dark4.98:1. No horizontal overflow. Original light focus2.16:1/border1.15:1;
original 320px content grid extended to342px; native date segments lost host focus-visible.
Audit harness initially needed page-target/load/key-event/transition corrections; corrected
checks exposed the actual date focus and layout defects and all final scenarios passed.
Safe aggregate:reports/dashboard_keyboard_audit.json; local harness under ignored.local.
Screen-reader/VoiceOver, authenticated dynamic announcements/errors, forced-colors/zoom and
complete WCAG audit remain pending; do not claim full AA conformance or P1-UI-AUDIT complete.

Fresh tests:374passed/0failed/0skipped with disposablePG17.11 (cluster removed); default
351passed/23PGskipped;1upstream Starlette warning each. Locked offline sync passed using
workspace cache after default cache permission failure; Ruff86files/mypy36files/format PASS.
OBSERVATION/live disabled. No real broker-account call or recording. PriorQ/R/S/T work
preserved;no staging/commit/push/history rewrite. Hosted CI remains unconfirmed.
Next:P2-003R-A only when genuinely current metadata passes unchanged preflight; otherwise
continue the remaining documented accessibility checks without starting later trading phases.

Detailed keyboard/contrast evidence: [ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md](ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md).

Final verification (2026-11-06T19:04:39.712477+00:00 UTC): protected local bootstrap returned
READY_LOCAL with login verified, live/entries false and recording not started. The served
CSS matches the reviewed file byte-for-byte. Preflight still blocks CURRENT_CATALOG_REQUIRED.
Gitleaks scanned all 30 pending files: zero new findings, one unchanged previously documented
prose false positive; full-history scan passed existing exact allowances. Scanner settings
unchanged. Git whitespace check passed. No staging, commit or push.

## 2026-11-09T14:48:12.940990+00:00 — Google Drive OAuth and cloud storage VERIFIED

Desktop credentials verified locally without printing values. Implemented Google's maintained
OAuth library with exactly drive.file,S256 PKCE,state validation and ephemeral127.0.0.1
callback. Browser consent succeeded after the user added the Google test account;earlier
attempts ended/cancelled without tokens. Access/refresh tokens now saved atomically in
.local/google/token.json,mode0600,directory0700. Ownership/symlinks/endpoints/client identity/
scopes checked;exclusive local lock,bounded waits/network requests and explicit reauthorization
preserve old tokens if new consent fails. URLs,codes,tokens and remote errors are withheld.

Actual Drive v3 acceptance:created AlgoTrade-AI-Storage (app archive),uploaded and downloaded
one generated synthetic JSON file,116bytes,with matching SHA256
c49d466f6d206233385ae269167bb218b3b980238a3900f51337e8041ca17a26. File retained. Metadata/parent/download capability checks passed.
Existing AlgoTrade-AI-Storage and all existing user files untouched. No delete/update/share
operation,project-file upload,DB export or automatic POST retry. Private receipt with IDs
and checksum is.local/google/storage-test.json(mode0600);nothing sensitive is staged.
PostgreSQL remains operational DB;Upstox/settings/live flags unchanged,OBSERVATION/live off.
Prior Drive-not-connected statements are superseded only for OAuth/synthetic round trip;
encrypted backup/export/restore/scheduling remain unimplemented.

23new synthetic security tests pass. Exact staged source snapshot:397passed/0failed/0skipped
with disposablePG17.11,including existing privilege checks. Candidate Ruff90files and strict
mypy38backendfiles pass. Full working tree:408passed/0failed/0skipped,including11earlier pending report cases
that are deliberately outside this commit. One upstream Starlette warning remains. Locked uv sync,
pip-audit(no known vulnerabilities),format and initial source secret scans passed.
Temporary PG clusters removed. New local commit is authorized;no push. Earlier pending
Phase2 report/source/test/docs remain outside this task-only commit.

Files:backend/app/storage/__init__.py,google_drive.py;scripts/google_drive.py;

docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md,VERIFICATION.md and all8agent_memory records.
Next:review encrypted archive/database-export and isolated restore workflow before storing
sensitive backups;Google OAuth is separate from pending Upstox OAuth and Phase2 observation.

Final security verification:18staged files passed default-rule Gitleaks without ignores;actual Google credential/token values absent. Staged/working whitespace checks pass. Private Google files remain ignored;no push.

## 2026-11-09T15:15:03.424403+00:00 — Manual encrypted PostgreSQL Drive backup and restore VERIFIED

## 2026-11-09T15:46:17.476184+00:00 — Three-day cloud-first backups installed and checked

User requested backups every3days with minimal Mac storage and reported no offline recovery
copy. Installed per-user LaunchAgent com.algotrade-ai.cloud-backup,daily21:30IST due check.
Only when3IST calendar dates have elapsed since the last backup creation does it run the
existing encrypted upload/download/isolated-restore pipeline. Re-verifying an old backup
cannot postpone the due date. Next due12November2026 at21:30IST,subject to Mac/user/Docker
availability. No RunAtLoad backup,KeepAlive retry loop,broker startup or cloud retention
deletion. Host IST clock verified;changed timezone blocks and records scheduled execution.

Actual forced cloud-only job VERIFIED;new backup retained only on Drive,not as local
.atbackup. Legacy cache cleanup freshly downloaded/authenticated the matching cloud copy
before removing one exact app-owned local ciphertext,freeing4,870,741bytes. Keys,receipts,
unverified files,operational data and all Drive files preserved. Local cache now0archives.
Working PostgreSQL remains local;only small keys/metadata and runtime remain alongside it.
Source-aware cleanup/Drive calls reuse existing protected OAuth scope and local locks.

Installed job completed a real background check,exit0/SKIPPED_NOT_DUE. Initial10second
probe preceded completion;later private receipt/exit status verified execution. No unsupported
privacy/block conclusion. No extra backup during that check. Safe proof is ignored
.local/verification/schedule_acceptance.json. Job JSON is bounded/fixed-size;stdout/stderr
go to/dev/null and raw subprocess output is never copied to status. Actual attempts are
separate from skipped checks so failures stay visible. Overlap is locked;timeout requests
SIGINT only on its own child,allows cleanup grace and records pending cleanup instead of
SIGKILL. Installer refuses conflicting agents;disable refuses active jobs and removes only
its matching inactive agent. No global/root agent,cron,environment or Upstox changes.

Offline recovery copy is still NOT_CONFIRMED:user explicitly has none. Scheduling does
not solve device-loss/key-loss recovery. Next:prepare an independently protected recovery

## 2026-11-10T10:43:24.854270+00:00 — Passphrase-encrypted Drive recovery implementation

User explicitly selected an encrypted recovery kit on Drive. Added bounded Argon2id
(64MiB/3iterations/4lanes) and AES256GCM wrapping of the existing backup key plus a
projected verified backup receipt. Random salt/nonce; no Google/broker credentials bundled.
Create-only drive.file upload/download with metadata and SHA256 checks; original key remains
unchanged. Passphrase only in hidden local TTY/native prompts, never stored or passed in argv.
Cloud verification unwraps the downloaded kit and restores the downloaded backup into the
existing isolated, non-superuser, network-none disposable target. recover-local accepts
manually downloaded ciphertext without original key or Google credentials; no source restore.
Health distinguishes locally verified matching cloud kit from unconfirmed physical offline
copy; invalid optional receipts do not interrupt backup scheduling. No ciphertext cache.

21new synthetic cases;48combined recovery/schedule tests pass. Full working suite476passed,
0failed,0skipped with disposable PostgreSQL17.11. Ruff104files,format,strictmypy43backend
files and locked sync pass. One existing non-fatal Starlette warning remains. An initial
new test misused encrypt_dump return type; corrected the test and reran successfully.
Actual hidden-prompt attempt ended without creating a pending/verified receipt or uploading
a kit. Cloud acceptance remains pending operator passphrase entry; no verification claimed.
Prompt timeouts now return a fixed safe code, covered by a regression test. Exact staged checks/security/commit recorded separately.

Prior Phase2 changes remain separate. PostgreSQL stays operational,OBSERVATION/live disabled;
no Upstox change,new market capture,push,cloud deletion or production cutover.
Next:complete hidden prompts,verify actual Drive recovery,then resume eligible genuine
market-hours observation;Upstox OAuth/calendar/seven-day evidence gates remain incomplete.
